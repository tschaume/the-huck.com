Launching the-huck.com
----------------------

This post launches my personal page the-huck.com.

The page is developed in python flask and the blogposts written in asciidoc
markup language. Attached as older posts are parts of the asciidoc userguide to
demonstrate the rendering of asciidoc text files into html. The page's source
code is published at https://github.com/tschaume/the-huck.com.

Stay tuned for more to come ...
